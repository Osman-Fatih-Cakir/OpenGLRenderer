# OpenGLRenderer
An OpenGL renderer.

(Not tested on another device)


Note:
In this project, my goal is to build a renderer using OpenGL. I will try to learn and implement common realtime computer graphics techniques.
Since I am new to computer graphics, I would be happy to receive suggestions about the project and how I can improve myself :).
