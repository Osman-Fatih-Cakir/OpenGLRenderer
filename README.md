# OpenGLRenderer
An OpenGL renderer.

In order to run on Visual Studio, make the solution platform to x86.

Techniques that I used so far:
- Deferred shading
- Directional light shadows
- Point light shadows

Note:
In this project, my goal is to build a renderer using OpenGL. I will try to learn and implement common realtime computer graphics techniques.
Since I am new to computer graphics, I would be happy to receive suggestions about the project and how I can improve myself :).
